# DevbgJobsCrawler
 
Jobs Crawler for DevBg. Which allows us to get all the junior jobs and see the results order by the language we want.
We write all founded jobs according to our wish in a text file in RawData folder. Every job is saved with the name, date, and link to the job. Sorted in chronological order.
